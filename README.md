# P.I.G.S GUI

## Info
- GUI stands for general user interface.
- Configuration & utility program for [P.I.G.S](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System) LightGun ecosystem.
- Orginally forked from SeongGinos [GUN4ALL GUI](https://github.com/SeongGino/GUN4ALL-GUI). Much like P.I.G.S itself I liked GUI but wanted different so here we are .

## Features

 - Simple to use & update. 
 - Turn rumble and/or solenoid on or off.
 - Testing utility for button input & solenoid/rumble force feedback.
